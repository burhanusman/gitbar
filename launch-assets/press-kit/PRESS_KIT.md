## Product Description

GitBar is a lightweight macOS menubar application that provides real-time git status monitoring for developers. Built for anyone working with git repositories - especially those using AI coding tools like Claude Code and Codex - GitBar eliminates context switching by putting repository status right in your menubar.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time git status monitoring (branch, ahead/behind, uncommitted changes)
- Auto-discovery of Claude Code and Codex projects
- Support for any git repository via manual folder addition
- Native macOS menubar integration with no Dock icon
- Automatic updates via Sparkle framework
- Open source (MIT license)
- Zero configuration required

**Perfect For:**
- Developers using Claude Code, Codex, or similar AI coding assistants
- Anyone managing multiple git repositories simultaneously
- Teams who need to stay in sync with their repositories
- Solo developers juggling multiple projects

---

## The Story

GitBar was born from a common developer frustration: losing track of which projects have uncommitted changes or unpushed commits. The constant context switching - opening terminals, running `git status`, checking multiple repositories - breaks flow and wastes time.

As a developer working extensively with Claude Code, the creator found himself constantly checking git status across multiple projects, never quite sure which ones needed attention. GitBar solves this by making git status always visible in the menubar - glanceable, lightweight, and unobtrusive.

Built as a personal tool to solve a real problem, GitBar is now open source and free for the developer community.
