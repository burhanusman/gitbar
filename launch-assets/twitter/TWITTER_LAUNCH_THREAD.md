# Twitter/X Launch Thread

## Launch Thread (5 tweets)

### Tweet 1 - The Hook (with GIF)
```
🚀 Introducing GitBar - git status in your macOS menubar

Stop switching to terminal just to check if you have uncommitted changes.

Perfect for developers using Claude Code, Codex, or any git workflow.

Free & open source ✨

🔗 https://gitbar.app
⬇️ brew install --cask gitbar

### Tweet 2 - The Problem
```
The problem: You're deep in flow, working across multiple repos.

"Did I commit that fix?"
"Do I have unpushed changes?"
"Which branch am I on again?"

Context switching kills productivity. GitBar puts the answers in your menubar - where they belong.

### Tweet 3 - Key Features
```
What makes GitBar special:

✨ Zero config - auto-discovers Claude Code & Codex projects
✨ Real-time git status updates
✨ See all repos at a glance
✨ Native macOS design
✨ Open source (MIT)
✨ Auto-updates built-in

Lives in your menubar. No Dock icon. Just works.

### Tweet 4 - The Origin Story
```
Why I built this:

Using Claude Code, I'd lose track of which projects had changes. Constantly switching terminals, running `git status`, feeling scattered.

Built GitBar to solve my own problem. Now I see everything at once.

Sometimes the best tools come from scratching your own itch 🛠️

## Hashtags Strategy

- #Productivity

### Secondary Hashtags (for follow-up tweets)
- #Developer
- #MacOSDev
- #SwiftUI
- #IndieHacker
- #BuildInPublic

### When to Use Hashtags
- **Launch thread**: 2-3 hashtags in final tweet only
- **Follow-up tweets**: 1-2 relevant hashtags
- **Reply tweets**: Usually none (focus on conversation)

## Timing Strategy

### Best Times to Launch
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Highest engagement
- **9-11 AM PST**: Catches both coasts during work hours
- **Avoid**: Weekends, holidays, major tech events (Apple WWDC, etc.)

### Recommended Schedule

**Day 1 (Launch Day)**
- 9:00 AM PST: Post launch thread
- 11:00 AM PST: Retweet with additional context
- 2:00 PM PST: Share a user testimonial or milestone
- 5:00 PM PST: Evening recap + engagement with replies

**Day 2-3**
- Share on Product Hunt
- Quote tweet your launch with Product Hunt link
- Engage with anyone who mentions GitBar

**Week 1**
- Share milestones (100 stars, 500 downloads, etc.)
- Post user testimonials
- Behind-the-scenes development stories

---

## Accounts to Tag/Notify

### Relevant Accounts (Tag when appropriate)

**Tech/Dev Influencers**
- @swiftlang (if they engage with Mac dev tools)
- @github (when sharing open source milestone)
- @homebrew_brew (when highlighting Homebrew support)

**Communities**
- @MacOSApps (curates Mac apps)
- @ProductHunt (when featured)
- @IndieHackers (indie maker community)

**Tools We Integrate With**
- @ClaudeAI (tag when mentioning Claude Code integration)
- Don't spam, but genuine integration mentions are fair

### When to Tag
- ✅ When genuinely relevant to their content
- ✅ When they asked "what tools do you use?"
- ✅ When sharing a milestone (with gratitude)
- ❌ Don't tag in initial launch (looks spammy)
- ❌ Don't tag multiple accounts in one tweet

```
Great idea! 💡

```

### When someone stars/downloads
```
Thank you! 🙏 Hope it makes your workflow smoother.

Let me know if you hit any issues or have ideas for improvements!
```

### When someone asks "why not just use terminal?"
```
Great question!

Terminal is powerful, but context switching breaks flow. GitBar gives you awareness without interruption.

Think of it like: You could check your phone for time, or just glance at your watch 🔄
