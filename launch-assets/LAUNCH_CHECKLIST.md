## Response Templates

### Product Hunt Comments

**General Thank You**
```
Thanks for checking out GitBar! 🙏

Let me know if you have any questions - happy to help!
```

**Feature Request**
```
Great suggestion! 💡

I'm tracking feature requests in GitHub issues. Want to open one so we can discuss details?

https://github.com/burhanusman/gitbar/issues
```

**Bug Report**
```
Thanks for reporting! 🐛

Can you share more details in a GitHub issue? I'll get on it ASAP.

https://github.com/burhanusman/gitbar/issues
```

**Question: "How is this different from terminal?"**
```
Great question!

GitBar is about awareness without context switching. You could check terminal every time, but GitBar gives you that info at a glance - like checking your watch vs pulling out your phone.

It's for when you want to know "do I have uncommitted work?" without breaking flow.
```

**Question: "Does it slow down my Mac?"**
```
Nope! GitBar is super lightweight. It only polls git when you have the menu open, and uses minimal CPU/memory.

I use it all day every day on my M1 MacBook - no performance impact.
```

**Question: "Will you add feature X?"**
```
[Feature] is a great idea!

I'm focusing on stability for v1.0, but definitely want to explore this. Can you open a feature request on GitHub so we can track it?

https://github.com/burhanusman/gitbar/issues
```

**Compliment**
```
Thank you so much! 🙏 That means a lot.

Hope GitBar makes your workflow smoother. Let me know if you have any feedback!
```

**Criticism**
```
Thanks for the honest feedback! I appreciate it.

[Address specific point if valid, or explain reasoning if not]

Always happy to discuss how to make GitBar better. What would make it work better for you?
```

### Twitter/X Replies

**Someone Tried It**
```
Awesome! 🎉

How's it working for you? Any feedback or features you'd like to see?
```

**Someone Starred/Downloaded**
```
Thank you! 🙏

Let me know if you hit any issues or have ideas for improvements!
```

**Feature Request**
```
Love this idea! 💡

Mind opening a GitHub issue so we can track it?

https://github.com/burhanusman/gitbar/issues
```

**Bug Report**
```
Oh no! 🐛

Can you open an issue with details? I'll investigate ASAP.

https://github.com/burhanusman/gitbar/issues
```
